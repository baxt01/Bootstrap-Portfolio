# portfolio

## Description 

I have been working on a Bootstrap-portfolio design,
The HTML structure is considerabley more complex to meet the needs of the framework.
I have added a inde.css file to add some etra styles outside of the reaches of bootstraps libraries,
I have also used some hover effects on links and buttons along with some boxshaddows,
There is a wider range of elements involved in this type of project ranging from container-fluid with rows & columns to cars within a grid and utilising the gutters.

## Installation

This codebase will run locally or in an online enviroment but should always have an internet connection to be able to see the custom fonts and other working scripts for the bootcamp framework that run from a CDN library, 
There's all you should need to do is setup the directory structor as follows:
root directory;
> index.html

>>> css (directory)


>>> images (directory)


>> css


>>> index.css


>> images


>>> IDE.png


>>> Michael.jpg

Once these files are correctly placed you can directly load the index.html file.
